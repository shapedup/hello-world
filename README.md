My first repository, hello!<br>
Pete here.<br>
I have only recently started learning how to program via an online course and so far JavaScript is my favourite language. Before starting the course I had some vague notions of what it means to be a programmer with some exposure to MATLAB and VBA, but it wasn't until I decided to commit to learning it by myself that I have found my love for it.<br>
I am currently part way through a Full Stack Foundations e-course. I figured this would be the best course to follow so to expose me to the most amount of languages in one place and to give me a feel for both Front-End and Back-End. After two months I've completed most of the Front-End part of the course and entering the Back-End subjects, I've just started a module on Flask Basics.<br>
Now that I have approximately 1/3rd of the course to go I figured it was time to start putting projects here.
